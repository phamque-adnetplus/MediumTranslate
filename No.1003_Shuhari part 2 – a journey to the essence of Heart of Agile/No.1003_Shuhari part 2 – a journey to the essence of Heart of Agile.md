## Shuhari part 2 – a journey to the essence of Heart of Agile

### Ancient Japanese wisdom applied to Scrum (or other Agile practices)

Yesterday I wrote an introduction to Shuhari, which you can find here:
[**Shuhari - the Japanese route to mastery**
*Shuhari is a Japanese term which is best known to describe the overall progression of martial arts training.*medium.com](https://medium.com/@WJAgeling/shuhari-an-introduction-2f7f7cd81608)

This post will be about applying Shuhari as part of philosophy of Heart of Agile. The setting will be a team working according to the rules of the Scrum Guide.

**Shu — *“to abide by; to defend “***

The starting position is a team that just adopted Scrum. They are all new in this, so they follow everything by the book.

* The Sprint is one month, planning is eight hours, sprint review is four hours, sprint retrospective takes three hours

* During the daily scrum they will follow the concept of the three questions (what did I do yesterday, what will I do tomorrow, did I have any impediments)

* An increment is finished at the end of the sprint

* And many other practices directly copied from the Scrum Guide

**Ha — *“to break”***

Here a team may learn about different Agile practices, like:

* Kanban — as a result the team decides to limit Work in Process. An example can be that a team only works on one item at a time

* Pair programming — two programmers working together at one workstation

* #NoEstimates — dropping story point estimating and switching to a fixed number of stories to plan a Sprint

* A team uses inspect and adapt from Scrum and concludes that they could reduce the Sprint length to two weeks.

**Ri — *“to leave; to depart”***

Here a team is learning from it’s own experiences to form it’s own practices, like:

* Letting go of the fixed sprint length — a team may decide that they base the sprint length on the length of the items at hand

* Dropping a Scrum event — a team may decide that the daily scrum no longer fits their needs due to the way they collaborate

* Have 1 day Sprints — a team may decide to have all Sprint events repeated every day

***Kokoro = “Heart”***

Here is where it ends, according to Heart of Agile. From “Ri” we are arriving at “Kokoro”, which is about fundamentally understanding the basics. I don’t have examples of this state readily available. I guess it means I haven’t reached “Kokoro” for Scrum yet…

**Final words**

Heart of Agile can cover many individual topics. See an example below from the website of Heart of Agile ([Heartofagile.com](http://www.heartofagile.com)). On all the topics Shuhari can be applied.
